### *HnMI Workshop - Day 1 Summary*

Today we explored the intersection of the *human body, data, and technology* through the lens of *embodiment, biometrics, and creative coding. The session focused on understanding the body not just as a biological entity, but as a **medium, a tool for expression, and even as data itself*.

#### *Key Concepts Covered:*
- *The Body:* Discussed as both a tool for expression and a topic of study, navigating the tension between *science vs. culture* and *body vs. mind*.
- *Phenomenalism:* The idea that our lived experiences shape our identities.
- *Body as a Social Construction:* How both physical and digital presences influence how we perceive ourselves and others.
- *Claiming Data:* Data can be a source of *joy, liberation, and self-awareness* rather than just surveillance.
- *Small Data vs. Big Data:* Focusing on intimate, personal data collected from our own bodies.

#### *Hands-on Prototyping:*
We built *DIY soft pressure sensors* using:
- *Velostat* (acts as a variable resistor based on pressure)
- *Conductive materials* to allow current flow
- *Arduino* for data acquisition

*Sensor Structure:*
- Layer 1: Conductive Material
- Layer 2: Velostat (pressure-sensitive)
- Layer 3: Conductive Material

#### *Arduino Code for Sensor Reading:*
cpp
int sensorPin = A0;
int sensorValue;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(sensorPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  delay(1000);
}

This code reads the analog signal from the pressure sensor and sends the data to the serial monitor.

#### *Data Visualization with Processing:*
java
import processing.serial.*;

Serial mySerial;
String myString;
int nl = 10;
float myVal;

void setup() {
  size(800, 600); // Canvas size
  printArray(Serial.list()); // List available ports
  delay(1000);
  String myPort = Serial.list()[0]; // Select the first available port
  mySerial = new Serial(this, myPort, 9600);
}

void draw() {
  while (mySerial.available() > 0) {
    myString = mySerial.readStringUntil(nl);
    background(125, 0, 125);
    if (myString != null) {
      myVal = float(myString);
      println(myVal);
      circle(width / 2, height / 2, myVal);
      smooth();
    }
  }
}

This code visualizes the pressure data as a dynamic circle that changes size based on the sensor input.

#### *Reflection:*
Todayâ€™s workshop highlighted how our bodies generate data naturally through movement, pressure, and emotion. We explored how to *capture, visualize, and interpret this data* creatively, bridging the gap between physical sensation and digital representation.
